about:
  name: Model Name/Material Identification Name
  desc: The configuration file is generic and is created to be used for
    different material classification problems. The generic configuration
    adheres to the module requirement - particularly ``material code``
    which is the unique identifier as defined in the database and the grades
    which follows the :mod:``TradeETL.MaterialGradeCluster`` data class.

primary:
  material: < material_code />
  hs_codes:
    - < 8 Digit Code-I />
    - < 8 Digit Code-II />

# the secondary clustering, i.e., the material grades are not available
# define as per requirement in the child models based on this template repository
